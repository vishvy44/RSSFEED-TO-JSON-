                     "title":"",
                     "imagelink":"",
                     "status":""
                     "timestamp":""
                     "url":"",
                     "author":"",
      }]}
CODE WRITES THE CODE IN A TEXT FILE WHICH IT CREATES ITSELF,IF THE CODE IS ENCODED OR IN SOME OTHER LANGUAGE IT PRINTS THE JSON TO COMMAND LINE IN SAME FORMAT.
